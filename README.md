Title: 
Weather-Dashboard

Description: 
When a user enters a city name and clicks the search button they are presented with the current weather for that city. They are also presented with the 5-day forecast for that city. The user can also select to view the current weather and 5-day forecast weather for a previously searched city by clicking on the city name from the search history field.
This Challenge assignment was a good way to further my experience and understanding of using API keys to fetch data, and rendering select data to the page. It also furthered my experience with using the local storage.
